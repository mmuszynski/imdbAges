# imdbAges

This is a simple script to inject into an IMDB actor page to display approximate ages next to the year a given movie was released. It started as an attempt to give me an idea of how old certain actors were when they appeared in my favorite TV shows (and partially to assess how my own career has progressed).

Feel free to make changes or use for your own purposes.
